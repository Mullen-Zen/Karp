# KARP

## A fun little high-level programming language following the work of Robert Nystrom's *Crafting Interpreters*

This repository is currently under construction. Over the next series of commits, I'll be adding everything needed to get the language Turing-complete and off the ground. The ultimate goal of this project is to compile this new programming language (called Karp, or Karplang), but with a compiler written in said language.
What have I gotten myself into?

Feel free to skim [this file](./Documentation.md) for an overview of the language and its properties.

Special thanks to the one and only [Clownvis](https://clownvistotherescue.com/) (yes, as in Clown Elvis) for providing amazing background entertainment to work to with this project. Please go find this man online if you want to brighten your day a little and add some whimsy to your life.
